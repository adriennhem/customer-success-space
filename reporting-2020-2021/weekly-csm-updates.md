#### Focus

* Webinar finalisation - had a conversation with Remi and Mario on the steps required for set up, we are aiming to organise the webinar for existing customers on 11th of March. 
* Post sales review with Adrien and Mark. This was our first review and I think it helped us with closing the loop between sales and CS. Through the calls sales are more aware of how their recent deals are adopting GitBook and if their contacts are responsive, while CS can anticipate any potential large customers coming in.

#### Focus

* Per weekly update, focus primarily on day to day like updating segmentation, pipeline reviews etc.  
* Hubspot post-sales pipeline update. Added a stage between impact review and renewed to mark the clients who are 90 days (or so) from renewal. We did not have a stage for those who are in the process of negotiating. 
* No more auto-create a deal based on MRR as Sales team agreed that they will create manually for those deals that require CSM relationship.

#### Health updates

#### Focus

* Webinar finalisation - had a conversation with Remi and Mario on the steps required for set up, we are aiming to organise the webinar for existing customers on 11th of March. 
* Post sales review with Adrien and Mark. This was our first review and I think it helped us with closing the loop between sales and CS. Through the calls sales are more aware of how their recent deals are adopting GitBook and if their contacts are responsive, while CS can anticipate any potential large customers coming in.

#### Health updates:

#### Focus:

* Creating a webinar for existing knowledge base clients
* Discussions with Remi and Petros. I was missing some insights (happy/unhappy or new contacts within an org) I had previously from doing support and seeing topics that large customers discussed. Remi and Petros were able to offer suggestions which led to Remi creating this very handy[ Hubspot view](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/8443689/contacts/list/view/4651859/) of Intercom tickets created by tier A and B within last 28days.
