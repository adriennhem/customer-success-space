# Health tracking

## Why and how we track health?

We track health to understand if our customers are:

* very happy (good score)
* moderately satisfied (medium)
* unhappy (bad) 
* at risk of churn (churn)

This helps us track their satisfaction over time and take immediate action if we identify them at risk of churn. 

By speaking to clients and building an overview of their health and pain points we can also track and flag main areas of concern, features requests and improve over time.

To view or update client's health go into their organisation and view the 'engagements' tab on the left hand side.

[Customer Feedback Updates ](https://app.gitbook.com/@gitbook/s/gotomarket/v/master/customer-success/updates) - past notes from calls with our clients.

## Churn 

[Weekly Churn Updates](https://app.gitbook.com/@gitbook/s/gotomarket/v/master/customer-success/churn-updates) - information pulled from Chartmorgul notifications. We track churn above 300MRR and enrich the information by filling in reason for churn (sourced from the in-app survey or intercom chat). 

[Churn campaign ](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/ajrah9dt/outbound/series) - a series of 2 emails to help prevent accidental cancelations and get feedback on areas for improvement at GitBook.
