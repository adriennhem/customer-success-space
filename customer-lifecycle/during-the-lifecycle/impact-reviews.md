description: Recommendation: Impact reviews should be more focussed on what we have achieved and what we are planning with the client as opposed to "feedback session".

# Impact Reviews (QBRs)

![Impact review talking points](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

#### Why are we doing impact reviews?

* to track the customers progress in customer lifecycle
* to understand their health 
* to review progress on goals (ROI)
* to benchmark with other clients
* to educate about new features
* to discuss new opportunities

## **Best Practices**

* **DO** prepare for the call by reviewing the stated goals (SPICED) from the orchestration call. 
* **DO **compare your customers’ results to relevant peers in the industry ahead of the call and be ready to discuss them. 
* **DO** come to the call ready to find ways to further improve your customers’ business. \

* _**DO NOT**_ start talking impact achieved before first checking that their goals haven’t changed.  

## Impact Review structure

Effectively impact reviews have 3 parts:

* **Part one (1,2):** Intro, refresh on previous situation and review progress so far, stats, growth, how are they tracking against defined goals

_Things to think about: how many users do they have, are they contributing actively, are they using integrations , their most frequently searched terms or pages. Discuss potential roadblocks._

* **Part two (3,4)**: Benchmark with peers, best practices, recommendations and new features

_This is an opportunity for us to understand what is happening in their business - are they growing? Have they secured a new funding round? Are they struggling? _\
_This will help us with identifying opportunities for growth. _

* **Part 3 (5,6):** Strategy and commitment to next steps

## 1. Appreciate their time

* thank them for attending the call
* confirm the amount of time needed for the meeting 
* check if it is still suitable for them 
* brief the customer about agenda
* check if there are any other topics they would like to address 

## 2. Verify goals and review results

Review activity defined during Success Plan creation. 

Check :arrow_right: "Define timelines and assign responsibility in Success Plan"

_During our last meeting you told me that you wanted to achieve X during first 90 days to feel successful. Is that still applicable?_

{% hint style="info" %}
Most times client will say yes. If they disagree this is your prime opportunity to understand how their organisation has changed and how their goals have evolved.
{% endhint %}

_I had reviewed your progress and it seems like you have achieved Y and Z, although Q needs a bit more work. This is normal, and I would say that compared to clients B  and C who are using GitBook for similar use case you are doing well/comparable etc. _

## 3. Benchmark with peers and best practices

Think of clients in similar industry with similar use case, if they have good quality public docs share them with your contact.  

By sharing best practices and examples of their peer activities you can find more opportunities for future impact. This gap analysis is a logical bridge to a conversation about renewal and expansion. 

Based on your expertise working with similar customers, how should your customer scale their business with GitBook? If they have been growing, perhaps there is an opportunity to suggest a more cost efficient deal? 

## 4. New features

Review your notes from previous meetings. Has the client mentioned desired features which are now live? Consult with product team and have a look at our changelog.

## 5. Strategy

**Who else might benefit?**\
Has their team been growing? \
Are there any other divisions which could benefit from GitBook?\
Example: _they are using it for tech docs, but are they aware you could use GitBook for internal knowledge or wikis?_

**12 month goals and milestones?**\
****What do they want to achieve in the next 90 days?\
What milestone would help them feel successful?\
What activities do they need to complete to achieve THEIR desired outcome?

_When you know the desired outcomes of your customer, you can more easily plot a journey of success milestones that will get them there._

**Commitment to next steps: **\
Assign responsibilities and actions on both sides (internal + client).

## 6. Finishing off the call

* Summarise what you went over today 
* Confirmation of the action needed to make this happen 
* Highlight the date
* Clearly mention the next step
* Thank them for their time
