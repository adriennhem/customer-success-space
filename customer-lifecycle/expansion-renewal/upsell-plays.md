# Upsell

## Land and expand

We are making conscious efforts to use a land and expand model to our advantage. Majority of our clients are tech departments within larger organisation (land) who may or may not be aware of other possibilities to use GitBook. It's our job to learn about the clients organisation structure and identify opportunities to expand our business with them. 

As a CSM we should be able to identify opportunities for upsells and to collaborate with our colleagues from Sales on making them a reality.

### During meetings

During your impact reviews or other meetings with client. \
Does the client require feature that is not currently included in their plan? Could it solve their pain point or improve their experience?\
\
Suggesting a feature and explaining how it is going to solve their pain point can help you identify opportunities for growth.

### Growing number of seats

In HubSpot you will be able to see if the account is growing the number of seats. You will be able to find this information in Engagements tab in 'seats evolution past 90 d'.\
\
If the account has been growing consistently and has the a higher number of seats than the basic requirement in their plan (5 in Team, 20 in Business) we can initiate a conversation around an upgrade (or annual contract).

### New use case 

As mentioned above, often our initial purchase within company comes from a technical department who:

* may not be aware of other use cases for GitBook 
* are aware of the use cases but want to test it on smaller group before rolling out to more users
* have started using GitBook in early stages of their company and have grown but not rolled it out to the wider org

This is also prime opportunity for us to educate the customers and share examples of GitBook being used differently to their specific use case hopefully leading to expansion.
