## Why annual contracts?

One of our objectives and key results is to move 25% of top customers to annual contract. 

This is because annual contracts guarantee us a longer financial commitment from the client while giving them opportunity to fully understand our product and build the relationship with us. They also help us with more accurate forecasting and allow us to offer more competitive prices to our clients. 

## CSM and annual contracts

As a CSM your goal is to identify clients who could benefit from an annual contract. In ideal situation this would be all large customers but you may want to prioritise clients who are expanding or satisfied/have positive health scores as they are likely to be more inclined to commit to an annual spent. 

Once you have identified the opportunity you should work with the Sales team who will take over the deal, agree terms and finalise it.
