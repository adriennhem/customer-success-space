# Onboarding with the team

{% hint style="info" %}
Onboarding is aimed at the whole team and is conducted separately to the First Meeting which is to be held with main stakeholders.
{% endhint %}

Separately from this for all paid accounts we run [onboarding campaign via Intercom](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/ajrah9dt/outbound/series/14095). The campaign is structured as follows:

* 1st message to all Admins of paid organisations created less than 60 days ago. 
* 2nd message to all users if none of the admins booked the meeting sent 4 days after.

**All accounts above 450 MRR should also have a direct approach via email.**

## Onboarding call

1. **Getting started:**\
   Thank all those attending for their time and ask if there are any specific issues they would like to address. If there are any, take note and save time at the end of the call to go through them.
2. **Demo:**\
   In the GitBook org you can find an onboarding [space](https://gitbook.gitbook.io/onboarding-basics/) which helps us walk the client through basic features and address most commonly asked questions (see FAQ). \
   _Noticed a section missing? Feel free to add it in! _

## Successful onboarding: 

* Everyone understands basic function of the tool, team members are invited and their permissions are set up correctly
* Everyone in the org understands who is their CSM, there is no bottleneck blocking them from asking questions they might have
* Ideally integrations and imports are set up and functioning correctly although this may stretch to later optimisation stages

### Next steps:

Book a rough date for your first Impact Review!\
It's much easier to get their commitment early on and adjust if needed than chase later down the line when your client may have conflicting priorities.
