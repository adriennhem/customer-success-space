# Success Plan

## Drafting a Success Plan with the client

> A customer success plan is clear statement of “what” and “how” you will deliver value throughout the customer lifecycle. The customer success plan is built by understanding expectations—both your customer’s and your own

## 1. Understanding customer expectations

* What are they trying to achieve by using GitBook?
* What problems are they trying to solve?
* Are they using GitBook for internal or public documentation? Is it technical?
* Why GitBook specifically? Was it better positioned than other tools?

## 2. Defining goals 

To help us define clear goals that will be easily monitored and reported on during Impact Reviews we use SMART methodology. 

Those goals will likely vary depending on clients use case (internal documentation, public documentation, tech or non tech and open-source)

## 3 .Key metrics

> Every feature that isn’t being used represents something a customer is paying for, but not getting value from. This lowers a customer’s perceived value and, ultimately, impacts their willingness to renew at the current service/price level, or even renew at all.

## 4. Change management

**Clarification**: change management is understood here as a change in a teams behaviour, not a complete corporate overhaul of processes/implementation of software at scale since we are operating a land and expand model. 

During initial conversations with stakeholders build a good understanding of why did they decide to switch to GitBook. This 'Why?' can help onboard other members who may be less enthusiastic about the change.

> Ultimately new software users must have an Awareness of the “what” and the “why.” \
> Why did we buy this? What problem are we trying to solve? Why this? Why now? And what's the cost of not going along with it? That's often overlooked. \
> And building that Desire or “[what's in it for me](https://blog.prosci.com/understanding-why-people-resist-change)?” How is this going to make my life better or different? \
> And finally, building and reinforcing skills until usage becomes habitual. \
> For SaaS, this creates that magical application “stickiness” all entrepreneurs want: the product delivers its promised value, leading users to avoid switching to something else.  

What is their current process for creating docs and how will it change with GitBook? What barriers can we realistically expect with this change? How can we achieve client goals (not reform whole org)? 

## 5. Next steps

* Onboarding call
* Impact reviews (QBRs)
* Check-ins
