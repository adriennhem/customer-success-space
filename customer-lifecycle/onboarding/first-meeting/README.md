> It is not possible to go through this entire plan in detail during the initial onboarding call. Instead, focus on what the customer needs to do to get to first value and only touch on high-level milestones for the rest of the year, then send the rest of the plan in a separate document.

## ACE

“What would you like to accomplish on our call today?

 “Is there anything else you’d like to get out of the call?”

## Deepen Goals 

Get the understanding of clients requirements and definition of success. \
\
Define measurable goals for first weeks for example: \
"What needs to happen in the first 90 days for you to feel like we’re on the path to success?"

Use questions in:

and in Success Plan to help you define timelines and assign responsibilities

## Share best practices with the client

## Tips

* **DO** always manage the customer’s expectations. 
* **DO** ask what the customer is trying to achieve and how they would like to achieve it. 
* **DO** break down customer goals into manageable “success milestones.” 
* **DO** assign specific resources to move from milestone to milestone, for the customer and vendor. 
* **DO** ask a quantitative question to set up the initial success plan: ”What needs to happen in the first 90 days for you to feel like we’re on the path to success?” 
* **DO** use their response to shape the rest of the discussion, but keep in mind the agenda. 
* **DO** manage expectations from the beginning. 
* **DO** agree on a Joint Impact Plan early. 
* **DO** create methods of engaging the customer – appropriately – while setting up the platform, cleansing data (for example removing users), etc.
