# Prep for the first meeting with stakeholders

## Following up on the internal handoff

Confirm the information provided by Sales during the internal handoff. 

Remember that your clients' priorities or situation could have changed, so as best practice we recommend that you re-confirm the information received from sales. This will help avoid miscommunication later on. \
\
Ensure to fill in blanks in your knowledge by asking questions early on. 

## Useful questions to ask the client: 

How did you find GitBook? \
(Where did they come from, if we do not have this info from Sales)

### Business:

* What is your business use case? 
* Where are you headed as a business?
* Are you going to use other doc tools alongside GitBook?

### Internal documentation:

* How are you going to grant access to your users? Do you require SSO or visitor authentication set up?
* Are there any users from outside your org that will be accessing this information?
* Are you going to be utilising GitHub/Slack integrations?
* Do you have any existing documentation and if so on which platform? Have you tested the import function? 

### External documentation 

* What steps do you need to achieve before going live?
* Who will be the main contributors to the documentation? 
* Have you set up advanced branding?

### **Team (mapping)**

* What does your team look like?
* What are consistent issues your team runs into?
* What teams do not currently use our product?

### Measuring success:

* What challenges were you facing and what motivated you to solve them?
* What do you want to achieve with our product/service?
* Where are there bottlenecks in your current process?
* What is success for you? \
  In 12 months time how will you determine if this was a successful investment for you?

### **C**ommunication/planning

* When can your team attend the onboarding call?
* How often would you like to receive updates/communicate? (provide recommendation)
