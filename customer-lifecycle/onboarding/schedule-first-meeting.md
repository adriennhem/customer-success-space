# Booking the meeting

## Booking a meeting after handoff from Sales:

First, ensure you have all the required info from your colleagues in sales. If there is any information missing take note to ensure that you remember to discuss it during your call. 

1. **Reach out via email to book the meeting. **\
   Let client know how much time it will take, what is the agenda and the end goal. Ask if there is anything else the client would like to address.
2. **Meeting booked through Calendly? Update the invitation with finalised agenda.**\
   Share any resources or information to help your client prepare for the meeting.
3. **Confirm 2 days in advance if the date and time are still ok.**\
   Reach out 2 days in advance to confirm if the date and time are still suitable for the client.

The first meeting with the customer introduces you to the customer and vice versa. It is an opportunity to understand why did they decide to use GitBook and what impact can it have on their business.\
It will help you to define and deepen goals, discuss best practices and create a joint plan that will serve as a basis for your Impact Reviews (QBRs) in the future.

Hi John,

What to expect from our session:

* Understand your use case 
* Define and deepen your goals
* Discuss your workflow
* Discuss best practices

Is there anything else you would like to add?
