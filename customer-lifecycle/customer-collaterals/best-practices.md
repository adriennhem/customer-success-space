# Best practices

## Getting started:

****:books: **Use all the content blocks available**\
We have designed GitBook with an ease of use in mind, which is why we offer a range of content blocks that will help you make your documentation easier to write, organise and read. Simply select from the drop down box on the left hand side or use our keyboard shortcuts:`Ctrl+/ or âŒ˜ /`

****:eyeglasses: **Set clear titles and headers**\
****Make the most out of our multiple space search by setting clear titles and headers as your content is indexed by sections formed of higher-level titles (H1, H2 or H3). \
Make sure that your sections are not too big as we show 3 lines of information with each result, meaning that content can end up being hidden within that section and not appear in your results.

****:woman_teacher: **Ensure you have set up correct member roles **\
****If you are an admin, ensure that you sent correct invitation to the members of your organisation (reader, writer or an admin). This will prevent your team members from being unable to edit the content or create spaces later on. Read more about member roles [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/collaboration/team-management/setting-up-permissions).

****:nerd: **Get acquainted with our onboarding basics guide**\
****We have created a [basic guide](https://app.gitbook.com/@gitbook/s/onboarding-basics/) to help you get started. It explains how to navigate the editing panel and make basic changes to your space. 

****:bookmark_tabs: **Don't nest more than 3 pages underneath the "parent" page**\
****Although there is no set limit, we recommend that you limit the number of the child pages to make the navigation and finding your content easier.

## Knowledge bases:

****:round_pushpin: **Choose main topic groups**\
****To help you get started, choose the main topic groups you would like to address in your documentation. Planning the content and structure ahead will help you identify gaps in your knowledge base and avoid the need to reorganise your content in the future. 

:notebook: **Create short paragraphs**\
****Writing concise paragraphs will help you communicate information clearly. It will also help your readers to find what they are looking for on the spot.

****:thinking:**Include FAQ and review it regularly**\
****Check what terms are most frequently searched or inquired about and take note. This will help you address your readers questions head on, ensuring they are satisfied with your support.

****:interrobang: **Your documentation should help answer your users' questions **\
****Imagine yourself using your product for the first time. Think of what could be confusing and what questions you might have and ensure that your documentation addresses those. What is obvious to you may not be so clear to those who are completely new to your readers. 

****:projector: **Use rich content**\
****GitBook allows you to embed rich media easily. You can share content from Figma, Google spreadsheets or a video on YouTube to make your content more engaging and easier to navigate without a need to shift between multiple links and resources.

## Technical docs: 

****:page_with_curl: **Plan your pages structure** \
To make your content easy to navigate use the headers (H1, H2 and H3) to structure your paragraphs and groups to organise your wider space content. A good and consistent structure throughout the document will help you keep things organised and your users will be able to jump to most relevant sections straight away. 

****:supervillain: **Style guides**\
****Your company may already have an existing style guide that explains what language to use or  how to talk to users. To help you, we have limited the customisation options available in the design section so that you can ensure consistent style across all your docs and spaces without too much hassle. 

****:desktop: **Use visuals whenever possible**\
Using GitBook embeds, image blocks and graphs will help you convey technical concepts. When selecting infographics ensure that they are legible, simple and high quality. By default, the image size is proportional to the font size as their main purpose is to be inserted in line to your content.

****:busts_in_silhouette: **Collaborate with your support team** \
Your support team are likely to be interacting with customers more than you do. We recommend scheduling a quick session with them to help you get started - they are likely to have a wealth of information about what issues your customers face and your documentation is lacking. 

****:arrows_counterclockwise: **Make the most out of GitHub integration**\
****Are you familiar with GitHub and Markdown and prefer to work on the versions of your documentation directly there? No problem. By setting up GitHub integration you will be able to benefit from bi-directional flow that allows you to push your content on GitBook, your edits are pushed to a GitHub repository. Conversely, commits pushed to a GitHub repository are imported and stored.

****:man_technologist: **Finally, be conscious of your readers tech knowledge!**\
****Don't assume that the topic you are writing about is obvious and easily understandable, even if it is so to you. Remember that you have insider knowledge and your readers, even if technically capable may need detailed explanations to help them.
