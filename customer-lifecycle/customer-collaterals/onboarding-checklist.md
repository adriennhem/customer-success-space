# Onboarding checklist

Hello :slight_smile: 

We are excited to have you on board!

To help you get started we have prepared a checklist with recommended actions that will help you start creating your documentation in the efficient and painless way from the start.  

General:

* [ ] You have booked a group onboarding call for the whole team. 
* [ ] Your users have been assigned correct permissions (reader, admin, writer)
* [ ] You have understood the flow of drafts and merges
* [ ] You have set up correct privacy settings for your spaces (private, public) 
* [ ] You have created groups to help you organise your multiple spaces. \
  For example: Internal documentation and Public documentation
* [ ] You have used the import function to help you migrate your pre-existing docs. 

Internal documentation

* [ ] You have set up teams within your organisation to restrict access to private spaces that should not be exposed to the whole organisation, for example HR documentation. 
* [ ] You have enabled Slack integration to search your docs easily or GitHub integration for your technical or product knowledge bases
* [ ] You have set up SSO or visitor authentication (beta)

External documentation: 

* [ ] You have enabled Google Analytics or Intercom. 
* [ ] You have adjusted your URL or custom domain via Advanced settings in your space.
