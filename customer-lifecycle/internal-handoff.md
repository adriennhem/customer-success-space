## After internal handoff

Customer Success needs to confirm above information provided by Sales (during the first meeting with the client) and fill in any gaps by asking relevant questions.

## Customer handoff (external):

AE to intro CSM. CSM to schedule a follow up meetings and to advise customer on what help they can offer etc.

Usually, customer handoff is done during the final stages of pre-boarding or via email.
