# General info about our customers

We use a range of tools to track information and organise data. Hubspot is the best place to look for it as it contains direct links to the client dashboards in the tools below. 

#### Tools we use:

* Hubspot
* Amplitude
* Intercom
* Baked
* Chartmogul
* Tableau

## Finding information in HubSpot

Most up to date information is stored in[ GitBook Organisations ](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/8443689/objects/2-1138478)**not in** **Companies** tab. \
GitBook organisation are continuously updated and contain key links and data like renewal date or MRR. 

Client notes, tasks and success plans are also saved on the **GitBook Org** level NOT at company level. Companies, on the other hand, have the email interactions synced against them. Unfortunately this cannot be changed and is out of our hands for now (its related to the way Hubspot works).

#### Engagements

This is where we track health score, use case and seat changes plus any tickets created by organisation (you can review the actual tickets by clicking on Tier A and B Intercom interactions view linked in next page).
