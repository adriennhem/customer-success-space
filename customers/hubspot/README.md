# HubSpot

HubSpot is where all data by our clients is stored and regularly updated. We do not have a separate tool for customer success, therefore all information such us health, intercom interactions, notes, tasks and success plans are stored there. 

HubSpot contains links to more in depth customer information (previous page), different dashboards listed below and a post sales pipeline which references renewals and upsells. 

## Views available in Hubspot

### Post sales pipeline

Renewals can be found it the post-sales pipeline view on Hubspot

**What deals are visible in this view? **Only enterprise and annual deals over 500 MRR. Self-serve monthly deals are NOT visible as they automatically renew every month so there is no need for them to be tracked against a renewal date. You can still find their data in GitBook organisations view in Hubspot. 

**What does the close date mean? **Close date in this specific case means the date by which the contract should be renewed (not the date the deal has closed). As a best practice we should aim to renew the accounts at least 90 days ahead of that. 

**What amount should I put for the deal? **It should be monthly recurring revenue (MRR) as opposed to annual one. 

**What does each stage mean? **Have a closer look at Overview page where you will see detailed customer journey breakdown.

### **Organisations at risk (high contraction or NPS detractor)**

We attempt to contact those organisations ASAP to prevent churn or understand the underlying reasons for this.

### **Churn (this can be churn far in advance at the end of their billing period) **

We recommend double checking if this information is correct before you contact customer as sometimes they may be on custom plan (enterprise) or switch to joint plan with their parent organisation in case of expansion.

### **Tier A and B Intercom interactions (within last 28 days)**

This view offers more visibility on our largest clients. Through their interactions you can investigate: 

* if there are any new contacts within an organisation that you have struggled to build a relationship that you can now approach
* if a client is really dissatisfied and you need to take action beyond simply resolving their issue by our support team
